Data abstraction is a technique used in computer programming to separate the implementation details of a data type from its interface, allowing the implementation to be changed without affecting the code that uses it. This is often achieved through the use of abstract data types (ADTs), which are defined by the operations they support rather than their specific implementation, or through the use of interfaces and classes in object-oriented programming languages. Data abstraction helps to reduce the complexity of software systems by allowing code to be written in a modular and flexible way and by hiding the underlying details of data types from the user. 0.588261 0.561934 0.581532

Everyone. Debt is the true core curriculum. 0.560938 0.598611 0.571851 
Design students. They suffer, but make it fashion. 0.455755 0.708988 0.538167 
CS and psych. One debugs code. One debugs thoughts. 0.526407 0.450958 0.720786
